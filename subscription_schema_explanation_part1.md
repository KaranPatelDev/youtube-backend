# 📚 Subscription Schema Explanation

This document explains a conceptual model for a **Subscription System**, representing how users subscribe to various channels. The diagram presents this schema visually using entities, relationships, and data examples.

---

## 🎯 Core Idea

To **demonstrate the relationship between users and the channels they subscribe to** using a simple schema and data mapping.

---

## 📌 What the Diagram Explains

### 1. Entities Involved

- **Subscribers**: Represented by users `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`
- **Channels**: Represented by `CAC`, `HCC`, `FCC`

### 2. Schema Design

The schema implies three tables or components:

- **Subscribers Table** – stores user information.
- **Channel Table** – stores channel information.
- **Subs Table** – a **relationship table** (junction table) linking subscribers to channels.

---

## 🔁 Many-to-Many Relationship

The diagram illustrates:

- A single user can subscribe to multiple channels.
- A single channel can have multiple subscribers.

This is a classic **many-to-many** relationship model.

---

## 📄 Examples from the Diagram

- **User `a`** → subscribed to `CAC`
- **User `b`** → subscribed to `CAC`
- **User `c`** → subscribed to `CAC`, `HCC`, and `FCC`

### This shows:

- `CAC` has **three subscribers**: `a`, `b`, and `c`
- `c` has subscribed to **three channels**

---

## 🧠 Educational Purpose

The image helps in understanding:

- How to model relationships in a database
- The role of **junction/bridge tables** (like `Subs`) in managing **many-to-many** mappings
- Basic **data modeling** and **schema design** principles

---

## ✅ Summary

This is a simple yet effective visual representation of how subscription systems work, particularly useful for building systems like:

- OTT platforms (e.g., Netflix)
- Newsletter subscriptions
- YouTube-like platforms

The schema helps explain how users interact with multiple content channels and how databases handle such relationships efficiently.
