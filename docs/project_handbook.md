### Folder-by-Folder Deep Dive

- **public/**: Static files and temporary uploads. Used by Multer for local file storage before Cloudinary upload. Should be excluded from version control.
- **src/**: All application source code. Organized by responsibility for maintainability and scalability.
  - **app.js**: Express app configuration. Sets up middleware, static files, and API versioning. Entry point for all HTTP requests.
  - **index.js**: Main entry point. Loads environment, connects to MongoDB, starts the server. Handles fatal errors gracefully.
  - **constants.js**: Centralized constants (e.g., DB name). Ensures magic values are not scattered in code.
  - **controller/**: Business logic. Each controller handles a resource (e.g., user, video). Keeps route files thin.
  - **db/**: Database connection logic. Handles connection, error logging, and can be extended for pooling and monitoring.
  - **middlewares/**: Custom middleware for authentication, file uploads, error handling, and more. Each middleware is reusable and testable.
  - **models/**: Mongoose schemas and models. Each file defines a resource (user, video, subscription) with hooks, methods, and indexes.
  - **routes/**: API route definitions. Maps endpoints to controller methods and applies middleware. Supports versioning and modularization.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and classes. Error handling, response formatting, async wrappers, and Cloudinary integration.

## 5. Workflow & Data Flow Diagrams

### Request Lifecycle

```plaintext
Client → Route → Middleware (auth, multer) → Controller → Model → DB → Response
```

### Example: User Registration

1. **Client** sends POST `/api/v1/users/register` with form-data (avatar, coverImage, fields)
2. **Route** applies Multer middleware for file upload
3. **Controller** validates input, uploads files to Cloudinary, creates user, generates tokens
4. **Model** saves user, hashes password, sets up watch history
5. **Response** returns user data (without password), sets cookies for tokens

### Advanced Workflow: Video Upload

1. **Client** sends POST `/api/v1/videos` with video file and metadata
2. **Route** applies Multer middleware for video upload
3. **Controller** validates input, uploads video to Cloudinary, generates thumbnail
4. **Model** saves video metadata, owner, and stats
5. **Response** returns video data and streaming URL

### Data Flow: Subscription Aggregation

1. **Client** requests channel profile
2. **Controller** runs aggregation pipeline to count subscribers, fetch channel stats
3. **Model** executes aggregation, joins with user and video collections
4. **Response** returns channel analytics and subscription status

---

## 6. API Design & Documentation

### User Authentication
- **POST /api/v1/users/register**: Register new user (multipart/form-data)
- **POST /api/v1/users/login**: Login (JSON)
- **POST /api/v1/users/refresh-token**: Refresh JWT
- **POST /api/v1/users/logout**: Logout (clears tokens)
- **GET /api/v1/users/current-user**: Get current user (protected)
- **PATCH /api/v1/users/update-account**: Update user details
- **PATCH /api/v1/users/avatar**: Update avatar (file upload)
- **PATCH /api/v1/users/cover-image**: Update cover image (file upload)
- **GET /api/v1/users/c/:username**: Get channel profile (aggregation)
- **GET /api/v1/users/history**: Get watch history

### Video Management (suggested extension)
- **POST /api/v1/videos**: Upload video
- **GET /api/v1/videos**: List videos (paginated)
- **GET /api/v1/videos/:id**: Get video details

### Example: Register User
```http
POST /api/v1/users/register
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: { fullName, username, email, password, avatar, coverImage }
```
**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "fullName": "Jane Doe",
  "username": "janedoe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123",
  "avatar": "<file>",
  "coverImage": "<file>"
}
```
**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 201,
  "data": { "user": { "_id": "...", "username": "janedoe", ... } },
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

### Error Cases & Edge Scenarios
- Duplicate username/email: 409 Conflict
- Missing required fields: 400 Bad Request
- Invalid file type/size: 415 Unsupported Media Type
- Token expired/invalid: 401 Unauthorized

### API Versioning & Best Practices
- Prefix all routes with `/api/v1/` for future-proofing
- Use RESTful conventions: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Return consistent response format for all endpoints
- Document all endpoints with request/response samples

---

## 7. Authentication & Security

### JWT Token System
- **Access Token**: Short-lived, sent in httpOnly cookie or Authorization header. Used for authenticating API requests.
- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived, stored in DB, rotated on login/refresh. Used to obtain new access tokens without re-login.
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt, 10 salt rounds. Ensures passwords are never stored in plain text.
- **CORS**: Configured for frontend origin. Only allows requests from trusted domains.
- **Input Validation**: All user input validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Security Headers**: Use helmet for HTTP headers to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute-force attacks by limiting requests per IP.
- **Secure Cookies**: httpOnly, secure, and SameSite flags for all authentication cookies.

### Example: Token Generation
```javascript
userSchema.methods.generateAccessToken = function() {
  return jwt.sign({ id: this._id }, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY });
};
```

### Advanced Security Practices
- Use environment variables for all secrets (never hardcode)
- Rotate JWT secrets and refresh tokens regularly
- Log all authentication attempts and suspicious activity
- Implement account lockout after repeated failed logins
- Use HTTPS in production to encrypt all traffic

---

## 8. Database Design & Advanced MongoDB

### User Model
- **Fields**: username, email, fullName, avatar, coverImage, watchHistory, password, refreshToken
- **Indexes**: username, email, createdAt for fast lookups and analytics
- **Hooks**: Pre-save for password hashing, post-save for logging
- **Methods**: comparePassword, generateAccessToken, generateRefreshToken
- **Virtuals**: Computed fields for profile completeness, display name, etc.

### Video Model
- **Fields**: videoFile, thumbnail, title, description, duration, views, isPublished, owner
- **Indexes**: owner, createdAt, text index on title/description for search
- **Plugins**: mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2 for scalable pagination
- **Aggregation**: Used for analytics (top videos, trending, etc.)

### Subscription Model
- **Fields**: subscriber, channel, timestamps
- **Aggregation**: Used for channel stats, subscriber counts, and engagement analytics
- **Joins**: Uses $lookup to join with user and video collections

### Advanced Aggregation Example
```javascript
const channelStats = await Subscription.aggregate([
  { $match: { channel: userId } },
  { $lookup: { from: 'users', localField: 'subscriber', foreignField: '_id', as: 'subscriberDetails' } },
  { $group: { _id: "$channel", subscriberCount: { $sum: 1 }, subscribers: { $push: "$subscriberDetails" } } }
]);
```

### Indexing & Performance
- Use compound indexes for common queries (e.g., `{ username: 1, email: 1 }`)
- Monitor slow queries and optimize with explain plans
- Use capped collections or TTL indexes for logs/history if needed

---

## 9. File Upload & Media Management

### Multer Middleware
- Handles multipart/form-data, stores files in `public/temp/`
- Validates file types (MIME) and sizes (limit uploads to prevent abuse)
- Generates unique filenames to avoid collisions
- Cleans up temp files after upload or on error

### Cloudinary Integration
- Uploads files to cloud, returns secure URLs
- Handles images, videos, and transformations (resize, crop, optimize)
- Supports eager transformations for thumbnails and previews

---

## 10. Error Handling & Response Patterns

### Custom Error Class
- Standardizes error responses with status code, message, stack trace (in dev), and error details
- Used throughout controllers, middleware, and utilities

### Async Handler
- Wraps async controllers to catch errors and pass to Express error handler
- Eliminates repetitive try/catch blocks

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "data": null,
  "message": "All fields are required",
  "success": false,
  "errors": ["Field 'email' is required"]
}
```

### Error Logging & Monitoring
- Log all errors with context (request, user, stack)
- Integrate with monitoring tools (Sentry, Datadog) for alerting
- Return generic error messages in production, detailed in development

---

## 11. Testing, CI/CD, and Deployment

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: For models, controllers, utils (Jest, Mocha, Chai)
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints (Supertest, Postman)
- **Test Coverage**: Use coverage tools (nyc, istanbul) for quality
- **Mocking**: Use sinon or jest-mock for external services (Cloudinary, DB)

### CI/CD
- **Linting**: Prettier and ESLint for code style and quality
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or similar
- **Deployment**: Docker, cloud platforms (Heroku, Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean)
- **Environment Management**: Use .env files and secret managers

### Example: Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### Deployment Best Practices
- Use process managers (PM2) for production
- Enable HTTPS and secure headers
- Monitor health and uptime
- Automate rollbacks on failure

---

## 12. Performance, Scalability, and Monitoring

### Indexing
- Use MongoDB indexes for fast queries (username, email, createdAt)
- Monitor index usage and optimize as needed

### Pagination
- Use mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2 for large datasets
- Implement cursor-based pagination for infinite scroll

### Monitoring
- Use logging (winston, morgan) for request/response logs
- Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry) for metrics and alerts
- Track API latency, error rates, and throughput

### Caching
- Use Redis for caching frequent queries and session data
- Cache API responses for public endpoints
- Invalidate cache on data changes

### Scalability
